# Rwanda CO2 Emission Prediction Project

## Overview
This repository hosts the Rwanda CO2 Emission Prediction Project, an advanced machine learning initiative that leverages tree-based models such as XGBoost for predicting carbon emissions in Africa using Sentinel-5P satellite data. The project emphasizes robust statistical analysis and data processing to achieve high accuracy in emission predictions.

## Files Description
- `rwanda_co2_model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the full analysis, including data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- `train.csv`: The primary dataset used for modeling, derived from Sentinel-5P satellite observations.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies necessary to run the project.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository: `git clone [repository-link]`.
2. Install required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage
Launch `rwanda_co2_model.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment to view and run the analysis. The notebook is structured to guide you through each step of the process.

## Project Structure
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and handling of missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Examines data distribution, outliers, and feature relationships.
3. **Model Development**: Details the creation and tuning of the XGBoost model.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Discusses various performance metrics used to assess the model's accuracy.
